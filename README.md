# Rom-Sorter
Look no more! Here is a program to automatically remove all roms that are locked to other regions than yours. This is especially handy when downloading rom-packs with various regions and consoles.

This is the new and improved version of the old [Rom Sorter](https://github.com/Abbin44/Rom-Pack-Sorter) where the entire program has been ported to WPF from WinForms.
